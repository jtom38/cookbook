## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 1/2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (beef, pork, seafood, tofu, mushrooms, or more vegetables; you can increase up to 2 lbs/907 g)
- [ ] kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)
- [ ] freshly ground black pepper
- [ ] 2 carrots
- [ ] 2 onions
- [ ] 1-2 russet potatoes (2-3 yukon gold potatoes if you want to preserve the potato shape)
- [ ] 1/2 Tbsp ginger (grated)
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic
- [ ] 1 1/2 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc)
- [ ] 4 cups [chicken stock/broth](https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-chicken-stock/)  (if you're careful with sodium intake, you can use **water only**, or use **half stock + half water**)
- [ ] 1 apple (I used fuji apple; use as much as you like to add sweetness)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp honey
- [ ] 1/2 tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)
- [ ] 1 package [Japanese curry roux](https://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-curry-sauce-mix-roux/) (7-8 oz or 200-230 g; or use all of my [homemade curry roux](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-curry-roux/))
- [ ] 1 1/2 Tbsp [soy sauce](https://www.justonecookbook.com/soy-sauce/)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp ketchup

## Instructions

### Prep

Discard the extra fat from the chicken and cut it into bite size pieces. Season with a little bit of salt and pepper.

- Peel and cut the carrot in rolling wedges ([Rangiri](https://www.justonecookbook.com/rangiri/)) and cut the onions in wedges. Cut the potatoes into 1 ½ inch (4 cm) pieces and soak in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.
- Cut the potatoes into 1 1/2 inch (4 cm) pieces and soak in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.
- Grate the ginger and crush the garlic.

### Start cooking

- Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat and sauté the onions until they become translucent and tender.
- Add the ginger and garlic.
- Add the chicken and cook until it's no longer pink.
- Add the carrot and mix well to coat with oil.
- Add the chicken broth and bring it to a boil. Chicken broth contains a
different amount of salt. If you're careful with sodium intake or not sure if your chicken stock is too salty, you can use **water only**, or use **half stock + half water**. You can always add salt at the end of cooking.
- Once boiling, using a [fine-mesh strainer](https://amzn.to/2KxVavi), [skim the scrum and fat](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-skim-off-the-scum-and-fat-from-soups-and-stocks/) from the surface of the broth.
- Peel the apple and grate it (use as much as you like to add sweetness). I've been using [this grater](https://amzn.to/3szp2se) and love it.
- Add the honey and salt and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Add the potatoes and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
- Turn off the heat. If you use the store-bought curry roux, put 1-2 blocks of roux in a ladle and slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks. Continue with the rest of the blocks.
- If you're using homemade curry roux, scoop a ladleful or two of cooking liquid from the curry broth and add it into the curry paste in a saucepan. Add more cooking liquid if necessary and mix well until it’s smooth.
- Add the roux mixture back into the soup and stir to combine.

### To Season the Curry

- Add soy sauce and ketchup (and any other condiments you're adding - see the blog post). Simmer uncovered on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the curry becomes thick.

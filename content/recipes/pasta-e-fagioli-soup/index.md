## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil plus extra for drizzling
- 1 pound Italian sausage casings removed
- 3 carrots peeled and chopped
- 2 ribs celery chopped
- 1 onion chopped
- 4 garlic cloves minced
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 28 ounce can peeled tomatoes chopped, juice reserved
- Parmesan rind
- 15 ½ ounce can cannellini beans rinsed and drained
- 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth divided
- 1 cup water
- 6 ounces ditalini or other small pasta
- 2 cups sliced baby spinach leaves
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish
- 2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese for garnish

## Instructions

- Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium until shimmering. Add the
sausage and cook, breaking the sausage into chunks. Cook until lightly
browned, about 5 minutes.
- Add the carrots, celery and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally until the
vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.
- Add the garlic, salt, Italian seasoning, oregano and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute.
- Add the tomatoes and juice; stir to combine. Add the Parmesan rind, beans and 1 cup of the broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.
- Add the remaining chicken broth and 1 cup of water. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the soup to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
- Discard the cheese rind. Turn off the heat, add the spinach to the pot and stir until wilted. Check seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste.
- Ladle soup into individual bowls and garnish with parsley, grated Parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil if desired.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound dry pinto beans
- 5 1/2 cups water
- 1 2/3 Tablespoon [Better Than Bullion vegetable base](http://amzn.to/2vtVEXt)
- salt and pepper to taste (Honestly, mine didn't need any. The BTB flavored them perfectly. Taste them first.)

## Instructions

- Rinse off your pinto beans, and drain them using a wire mesh strainer.  
- Add them to the Instant Pot, along with the water and Better Than Bullion vegetable base.  
- Close and lock the lid, and cook on manual high pressure for 45 minutes. Note: It will take several minutes to come to pressure.  
- Allow the pressure to naturally release (Do not use the valve, but let it sit until the pressure indicator pin drops on its own. Takes about 26 minutes, FYI.

# Cookbook

I have always wanted to have a digital cookbook that i can use on a tablet.  I have tried several different ways to make this happen.  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is how this now comes together.  Its all then hosted on Github.io.

If you want to see some of the other things I am working on, check out my [github page](https://github.com/jtom38)!

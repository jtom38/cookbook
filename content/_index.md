# Cookbook

Welcome to the personal cookbook of [James Tombleson](https://github.com/jtom38/cookbook)!  This site contains recipies that my family likes to cook and stored in a easy location that we can use on a tablet.  The reason this site exists is so we can archive the recipies that we find online.  We have had sites go offline and had to use the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) to try to recover them.  This does not always work so thats why I wanted to make this site.  I dont want to lose anymore recipies that my family loves.

With this being a website, we can also share the recipies with family, friends, and now you!

You will be able to find everything that we have stored here!  This is a work in progress so things will be added over time.  

If you use github and find this helpful, leave a star to let me know you like it!

## Theme

The theme is custom and will be seperated from the site at a later time.  For now, its sill very much in the works and not something that is ready for primetime.

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds baby Yukon gold potatoes
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and fill it with cold water. Bring the water to a boil. Simmer the potatoes until they are just barely fork tender. Strain the potatoes and let them cool slightly.

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

1. Brush a baking sheet with 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil. Place the potatoes on the sheet. Use your hand or the bottom of a glass to smash them once, trying to keep them in one piece. Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the potatoes. Sprinkle the potatoes with the salt, pepper and garlic powder.

1. Place the sheet in the oven and roast the potatoes for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden and crispy. Remove and serve immediately. If desired, you can serve them with sriracha yogurt dip.

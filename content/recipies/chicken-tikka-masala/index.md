## Ingredients

Makes 6 servings

- 6 garlic cloves, finely grated
- 4 tsp. finely grated peeled ginger
- 4 tsp. ground turmeric
- 2 tsp. garam masala
- 2 tsp. ground coriander
- 2 tsp. ground cumin
- 1 1/2 cups whole-milk yogurt (not Greek)
- 1 Tbsp. kosher salt
- 2 lb. skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved lengthwise
- 3 Tbsp. ghee (clarified butter) or vegetable oil
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup tomato paste
- 6 cardamom pods, crushed
- 2 dried chiles de árbol or ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes, like San Marzano
- 2 cups heavy cream
- [] 3/4 cup chopped cilantro, plus sprigs for garnish
- Steamed basmati rice (for serving)

## Preparation

### Step 1

Combine garlic, ginger, turmeric, garam masala, coriander, and cumin in a small bowl. Whisk yogurt, salt, and half of spice mixture in a medium bowl; add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and chill 4-6 hours. Cover and chill remaining spice mixture.

### Step 2

Heat ghee in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, tomato paste, cardamom, and chiles and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste has darkened and onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add remaining half of spice mixture and cook, stirring often, until bottom of pot begins to brown, about 4 minutes.

### Step 3

Add tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands as you add them. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot, until sauce thickens, 8-10 minutes.

### Step 4

Add cream and chopped cilantro. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 30-40 minutes.

### Step 5

Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside sheet. Arrange chicken on rack in a single layer. Broil until chicken starts to blacken in spots (it will not be cooked through), about 10 minutes.

### Step 6

Cut chicken into bite-size pieces, add to sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Serve with rice and cilantro sprigs.

Do Ahead: Chicken can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; chill. Reheat before serving.
